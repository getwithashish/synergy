				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
			<p>
				PNR - Passenger Name Record is an unique number that recognizes your booking.<br>
	PNR is a travel record of an individual or a group of individuals, maintained in CRS (Central Reservation System) database.<br>
	This code is generated only when the CRS gets full data of journey like passenger's name, gender, age, train number, journey class, berth preference, contact link, etc
	PNR is per ticket and not for person. If multiple members are booked together on one ticket, then Only one PNR number will be allocated for it.
	Indian Railways has a 10-digit numerical PNR number.

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
			<p>PNR is utilized to get the Confirmed or Waitlisted status of your booking along with the coach and seat numbers.
				Basically PNR is used in "follow-up" process by which passengers are able to get updates about the status of their journey.
				This 10-digit numerical PNR number of Indian Railways is of great use to passengers, whose tickets are not confirmed.
				PNR helps passengers to check whether their tickets got confirmed or not.

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
			<p>On a paper ticket released in a railway booking counter, the PNR number is on the top left of the ticket.
				The PNR number on ticket might be split right into 3-7(digits) form (e.g. 890-1234567) on paper ticket.
				On IRCTC e-ticket or any other agency e-ticket the PNR number can be on the top left of the ticket.
				PNR might also be on SMS alert on your mobile if you have booked e-ticket and provided your mobile number.

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>What is "Chart Not Prepared" status?</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
			<p>The last booking chart for a train will be done at least 4hrs prior to the schedule departure of the train at origination station.
				But in reality charts have been getting prepared 1 or 2 hrs prior to the actual departure of the train.
				In situation of early morning or late evening trains, this might be prepped considerably earlier during the previous night itself.
				Your booking standing might change any time till chart is prepared.
				Though quite uncommon, it is possible that an RAC ticket can change to wait-listed status.
				It is also possible that booking relocated from WL to CNF can return to RAC or WL.
				However none of this will certainly not happen for a ticket which was CNF while Booking itself.

			<p>When all available seats on a train are sold, Indian Railway or IRCTC releases RACs for railway reservations.

				These cancellations can get you on the train if you bought an RAC or WL ticket.
				When the reservation chart of a particular train is ready (usually meaning that the train is due to depart in a few hours) and there are still some available tickets in different quotas, those will be given to RAC/WL ticket holders.
